            The main character, Liam Hicks, is a frontiersman, woods runner and
            sometime scout for the British army during the French and Indian War
            (1754-1760) and the years directly following its ending. He is
            knowledgeable in the ways of the forests, having learned them at the
            knee of his Abenaki ‘father’ Kasko in the Abenaki/French village of
            Odanak. From this starting point, the books follow Liam through the
            Eastern forests of North America: to Detroit at the time of
            Pontiac’s War in The Heron’s Song, to the Ojibwa territory of
            Aamjiwnaang for Song of the Blue Jay, south past the Lake of the
            Eries and down to Fort Pitt in The Raven Calls, then to
            Michilimackinac and the shores of Lake Superior and the Ojibwa
            village of Batchawana in Trickster Raven and the Trail to
            Gitchee-Gami. Many well-known characters of the time also show up in
            each of the books: Robert Rogers, William Johnson, Charles de
            Langlade, James Stirling, Little Thunder of the Aamjiwnaang Ojibwa,
            Wasson and Perwash of the Saginaw Bay Ojibwa and the Odawa chief
            Pontiac amongst many others. The books also reflect my reverence for
            the nature of the Great Lakes and the rivers and streams that flow
            into them—their power, their beauty, their colours from deep blue to
            deep green and everything in between. And Pup? He is a composite of
            the five beautiful Springer Spaniels that have been part of our
            family over the past 40 or so years.
